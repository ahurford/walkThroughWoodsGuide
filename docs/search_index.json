[["index.html", "Walkthrough the woods 1 Background", " Walkthrough the woods 1 Background Plant can grow in length (primary growth) and girth (secondary growth). Primary growth increases the plant height/root length. This growth occurs via cell division at apical meristems located at the tip of shoots and roots. Secondary growth increases the circumference of shoots/roots. This growth occurs via cell division at the lateral meristems (vascular cambium and cork cambium). Only woody plants exhibit secondary growth (herbaceous plants do not). Plant stems have several functions, including support, transport and storage. Stems are made of a variety of tisues that help carry out these functions. The stems of angiosperms (flowering plants) contain several different cells and tissue types including: Parenchyma: thin-walled living cells that are responsible for storage and some radial transport over small distances Fibres: thick-walled cells with smaller lumens that are responsible for support and Vessels: dead cells with large lumens that are responsible for water transport The relative amount of specific tissue types varies in different types of plants (and their stems) depending on which functions are most important to survival in a plants given environment. STRUCTURE = FUNCTION. Structures used for one function may not be the best for another function and this often results in competing requirements for space and resources within the stem. Thus, there will be trade-offs in tissue allocation in stems. BALANCE. Fast vs. safe transport: A smaller number of large vessels will transport water faster than a large number of small vessels (due to less resistance to the flow of water). However, larger vessels come with their problems as they are at higher risk for embolisms (air bubbles) which block fluid flow. Embolisms can be caused in vessels by freezing (when air bubbles come out of solutions as water thaws) and drought (when air is sucked from one air filled vessel to another via pores between the vessels). Transport vs. mechanical support: A large number of vessels in a stem allows for a lot of water transport, but this leaves less space for fibres, which provide mechanical support (and vice versa). A stem with more vessels and less fibres would be weaker than a stem with less vessels and more fibres. Wood Density: Wood density is a function of the amount of different tissue types within the stem and is related to ecological and environmental factors. Wood density typically ranges from 0.1-1.2 \\(g/cm^{3}\\) (the density of water is 1 \\(g/cm^{3}\\)). A stem with lots of vessels or large vessels would be less dense (as vessels are hollow) then a stem with little vessel tissue (because more fibers). Dense Wood: Has better mechanical strenght (fewer hollow vessels) Is better able to avoid embolisms related to drought (smaller vessels) Is found in species with slower growth and lower mortality (slower transport) Has a lower decay rate, thus slower carbon turnover rates Other relevant considerations: Lianas are climbing flowering vines, because they climb and are not free standing, they have less need for mechanical strength and therefore can have more vessels and larger vessels. Some temperate species are known as ring porous species; as they grow, they make large vessels in the spring when water is abundant and smaller ones in the summer when there is less water. Other temperate species are diffuse porous species with smaller vessels (water abundance is the same year-round, relatively lower than tropical). Tropical species are generally diffuse porous with large vessels (water abundance is the same year-round, relatively higher than tropical). Which of the above species would be more likely to leaf out earlier in the spring? Why do temperate species have smaller vessels than tropical species? If you are unsure, re-read the background information or ask for clarification.

You are required to propose 2 question/problems that can be studied using the dataset provided. The you will formulate 2 hypotheses and select the appropriate information from the dataset to address each hypothesis. Finally, you will interpret and explain the result There are two (2) parts to the assignment: 2.1 Part I You are required to investigate whether there is a relationship between latitude and one (1) structural adaptation in plant stems (Please note that latitude relates to climate). It is mandatory that you use ALL the data in the latitude column as one of the variables. However, you may choose data from any one of the other columns as the other variable to study the relationship. You will present your results in a scatterplot with a line of best fit and analyse the data with the Pearson correlation coefficient. This will show the correlation between latitude and the structural adaptation of your choice. 2.2 Part II You are required to investigate whether there is a relationship between any structural adaptation in 2 categories of plant stems. Your investigation will be limited to 20 plants (2 groups of 10). How you group plants is up to you, but you will have to determine which plants fit into the groups, so some background research will be required on your part. For example, you can investigate any structural adaptation in any ONE of the following category sets or come up with your own categories (which must be approved by your lab instructor): Tropical vs. temperate plants (If you select this topic you are not permitted to use the variable that you studied in Part I), shrubs vs. trees, desert vs. rainforest plants, plants that grow in low elevation vs. high elevation You will have to define the specific criteria of your categories. For example, if you compare a structural feature of a stem for tall vs. short plants, you have to specifically state what qualifies as tall and what qualifies as short (as these terms are relative). This can be determined from your background research. To help with this research and sorting of data, you may want to check the following sites: Global Biodiversity Information Facility https://www.gbif.org/ OR https://www.canadensys.net. You will present your results with boxplots or bar graphs to compare the means between categories (ex. trees vs. shrubs) and a measure of error like standard deviation. You will determine statistical significance by performing T-test (more information about this topic can be found in: https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses). 2.3 Specific Instructions Title: Title should be concise yet informative. It should hint at the question or the results found in the project. This title is specific to the project and not a general write-up title. Introduction: Present background information that is relevant to the problems you are studying. This background information or theory should help to formulate the questions and hypotheses. The introduction should include the questions that you are interested in studying for each part. Again, for Part I, this must be a relationship between latitude and some structural feature in plant stems and for Part II, you may use the suggestions given or group the plants your own way. The introduction should end by providing 2 hypotheses (one each for Part I and Part II). Each hypothesis should be an educated guess which is formulated after you have done some background reading. Use information from peer-reviewed articles within your introduction. Methods: For Part I, state the columns of data that you worked with and the software used. For Part II, state the variable you examined, your 2 categories, the specific criteria used to include plants into each category and the software used. Results: For Part I, present a computer-generated scatterplot. In the text, describe the relationship you see (ex. positive, negative), give the Pearson correlation coefficient value and state if there any outliers (i.e. dots that are far away from the rest?). Avoid the temptation to explain what is going on, leave that for your Discussion section. For Part II, present a boxplot or bar graph (with standard deviation bars) to compare the means between categories. In the text, state which group has a higher mean value and which a lower mean value, the t-test value and if the two categories compared statistically different with respect to the structural feature. Again, avoid the temptation to explain what is going on, leave that for your Discussion section. Please Note: As part of the Results section for Part II, you are required to hand in a table including the plant species that you will be using in each category. This table should also include the appropriate data for the variable that you will be studying. Discussion: For both Part I and Part II, you are expected to begin by stating whether your results support your hypotheses. Then, explain why you see a relationship or, if appropriate, why not. As part of your explanation, find 2 related journal articles (1 for each part) and include details of their studies and relevant findings and state if the study results are consistent with yours (dont forget to cite these articles in your discussion). Regardless of whether or not your hypotheses were supported, you should explain other factors that could affect the plants/study results such as elevation, wind, herbivory, etc. Your discussion should be well thought out and show an understanding of the topic studied and the factors that may affect tissue allocation in stems.
