[["guide.html", "3 The Guide 3.1 Sample with t.test", " 3 The Guide Let’s explore the data! Review 7 Best Practices chapter of Quantitative skills for biology. It is best to make a folder on your computer Desktop where you will work on this assignment and to stay organize. Download the file wood.csv from the course BrightSpace. Review 8.2 Loading or importing data. Open and save a new R Script (see 3.2 Source Pane if you are unsure how to do this). TRY IT! One of the first commands of your R Script will be to load your data, for example: data1 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;woods_jake.csv&quot;) In the Console, inspect your data to check that it has loaded. TRY IT! For example: head(data1) If your data has not loaded, the most likely problem is a spelling error or problems with specifying the path to wood.csv. You might try: the RStudio way of importing your data, or moving wood.csv to your working directory. You will want to do some exploration of your data. See 8.4 Handling the data for how to recover the names of the columns for all the data. TRY IT! with the data you just imported. names(data1) ## [1] &quot;Family&quot; &quot;Binomial&quot; &quot;A.mm&quot; &quot;N.mm&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;logA&quot; ## [7] &quot;logN&quot; &quot;logF&quot; &quot;Dens&quot; &quot;AbsLat&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;X.1&quot; ## [13] &quot;X.2&quot; &quot;X.3&quot; &quot;X.4&quot; &quot;X.5&quot; &quot;X.6&quot; &quot;X.7&quot; ## [19] &quot;X.8&quot; &quot;X.9&quot; &quot;X.10&quot; &quot;X.11&quot; &quot;X.12&quot; See the metadata file on the course BrightSpace for an explanation of the meanings of the data columns. Read over the assignment instructions. It is now useful to began thinking about the data. Do you hypothesize a relationship between the data in any of the columns? TRY IT! You might start investigating your hypothesis by making a plot, for example, showing the Average cross sectional vessel area and the number of vessels. To extract a column of the data see 8.4 Handling the data. For the Average cross sectional vessel area, in the Console, try: data1$A.mm Be sure to type exactly A.mm after the $. TRY IT! Try making your plot: plot(data1$N.mm,data1$A.mm, pch = 19, xlab = &quot;Average cross sectional vessel area&quot;, ylab = &quot;Number of vessels per unit cross sectional area&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;) The column names exactly as the appear in the output of names(data1) or RStudio will produce an error. TRY IT! Can you make a plot of different variables, for example Wood density and Average of absolute value of latitude? TRY IT! What happens if you type plot(data1$Family, data1$Binomial) in the Console? Why is this not a very sensible choice for something to plot? To analyze the relation between variables we can use the cor(x,y,method = \"pearson\") function. And it will give us a numeric description of the data’s relation (for more information about this topic:) 3.1 Sample with t.test Structural adaptation: Average cross sectional vessel area Categories: Tall(Average plant height is greater than 3 meters) cat1 &lt;-data1[0:10,0:3] cat1 ## Family Binomial A.mm ## 1 Rhamnaceae Krugiodendron ferreum 0.002922467 ## 2 Fabaceae Tamarindus indica 0.010386891 ## 3 Anacardiaceae Astronium urundeuva 0.009503318 ## 4 Fabaceae Dalbergia melanoxylon 0.013273229 ## 5 Fabaceae Swartzia corrugata 0.018385386 ## 6 Fabaceae Caesalpinia paraguariensis 0.003848451 ## 7 Fabaceae Dinizia excelsa 0.025446900 ## 8 Boraginaceae Patagonula americana 0.004133158 ## 9 Bignoniaceae Tabebuia chrysantha 0.002281189 ## 10 Fabaceae Bocoa prouacensis 0.018385386 Short(Average plant height is less than 3 meters) cat2 &lt;- data1[11:20,0:3] cat2 ## Family Binomial A.mm ## 11 Euphorbiaceae Gymnanthes lucida 0.000855299 ## 12 Fabaceae Dipteryx odorata 0.024052819 ## 13 Bignoniaceae Tabebuia serratifolia 0.004964109 ## 14 Erythroxylaceae Erythroxylum pulchrum 0.001590431 ## 15 Fabaceae Pterocarpus santalinus 0.041547563 ## 16 Sapotaceae Manilkara bidentata 0.009852035 ## 17 Fabaceae Acacia erioloba 0.015174678 ## 18 Sapindaceae Dodonaea viscosa 0.002457511 ## 19 Rhizophoraceae Rhizophora mangle 0.003033290 ## 20 Fabaceae Zollernia paraensis 0.006939778 Means and standard deviations of both group of data: mean1 &lt;- mean(cat1[,3]) mean2 &lt;- mean(cat2[,3]) sd1 &lt;- sd(cat1[,3]) sd2 &lt;- sd(cat2[,3]) mean1 ## [1] 0.01085664 mean2 ## [1] 0.01104675 sd1 ## [1] 0.00792283 sd2 ## [1] 0.01292314 barplot(c(mean1,mean2), names.arg = c(&#39;cat1&#39;,&#39;cat2&#39;),main =&quot;Average of groups&quot;, ylim = c(0,0.0125), col = c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;)) For the t.test if we want to evaluate \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) if our p-value is greater than our \\(\\alpha\\) both means are not statistically different (based on the datasets).
