[["index.html", "A walk through the woods 1 Getting started and Learning R", " A walk through the woods 1 Getting started and Learning R We are increasing the focus on quantitative skills in our Biology curriculum, in response to changing demands and emphasis within the field of biology itself. In Biology of Plants (BIOL 2010) we are introducing students to R software and basic statistical concepts. The quantitative training guide has been writing to teach MUN biology students R coding to build a foundation for more advanced quantitative analysis of data in upper year Biology courses. We anticipate that this guide will also be a useful resource manual that you will refer back to as you use R in your future courses. Read Introduction. As you read through the next sections, if you encounter a word you do not understand you may wish to consult the Glossary. Follow the steps in R and RStudio to install R and RStudio. If you are having issues with installing the software, check the Frequently Asked Questions. Read Finding your way around RStudio. Have your RStudio software open. When you encounter TRY IT! or courier font text in a grey box, this is an example of code that we want you to try in RStudio. Note that you should type the code exactly as it is written. When you encounter EXERCISE or HAND IN this is a question that your laboratory instructor may ask you to complete and hand in. You may wish to re-size the windows on your computer to view both the quantitative training guide and the RStudio software, or you may wish to view the training guide on a tablet, with the software open on your computer. Work through Introduction to R. We will sometimes give you only part of the code, or we will give code that has a deliberate mistake in it. This is not to frustrate you - rather it is a way for you to start to develop your problem solving skills. Read the text before and after the example code carefully for clues as to what you should do. Proceed through the sections as assigned by your lab instructor. Expect to get stuck. This is normal when learning a new skill. Everyone who uses R, including professionals who have used it for years, gets error messages and have bugs in their code. You might look for help in Getting help or ask for help from an instructor as specified in section 3. Once you’ve finished the first-year labs, don’t forget that you have this resource. Whenever you practice using R you will get better at it. If you haven’t used it for a while, your skills get rusty, but by reviewing the relevant sections of the quantitative training guide you will quickly be able to catch up. Before you know it, you will be confidently doing quantitative work in R, which will increase your knowledge, enhance your ability to do advanced biology work, and give you a marketable skill in the work world. "],["background-information.html", "2 Background Information", " 2 Background Information Plant can grow in length (primary growth) and girth (secondary growth). Primary growth increases the plant height/root length. This growth occurs via cell division at apical meristems located at the tip of shoots and roots. Secondary growth increases the circumference of shoots/roots. This growth occurs via cell division at the lateral meristems (vascular cambium and cork cambium). Only woody plants exhibit secondary growth (herbaceous plants do not). Plant stems have several functions, including support, transport and storage. Stems are made of a variety of tissues that help carry out these functions. The stems of angiosperms (flowering plants) contain several different cells and tissue types, including: Parenchyma: thin-walled living cells that are responsible for storage and some radial transport over small distances Fibres: thick-walled cells with smaller lumens that are responsible for support and Vessels: dead cells with large lumens that are responsible for water transport The relative amount of specific tissue types varies in different plants (and their stems) depending on which functions are most important to survival in a plant’s given environment. STRUCTURE = FUNCTION. Structures used for one function may not be the best for another function and this often results in competing requirements for space and resources within the stem. Thus, there will be trade-offs in tissue allocation in stems. BALANCE. Fast vs. safe transport: A smaller number of large vessels will transport water faster than a large number of small vessels (due to less resistance to the flow of water). However, larger vessels come with their problems as they are at higher risk for embolisms (air bubbles) which block fluid flow. Embolisms can be caused in vessels by freezing (when air bubbles come out of solutions as water thaws) and drought (when air is sucked from one air filled vessel to another via pores between the vessels). Transport vs. mechanical support: Many vessels in a stem allow for a lot of water transport, but this leaves less space for fibres, which provide mechanical support (and vice versa). A stem with more vessels and fewer fibres would be weaker than a stem with fewer vessels and more fibres. Wood Density: Wood density is a function of the number of different tissue types within the stem and is related to ecological and environmental factors. Wood density typically ranges from 0.1-1.2 \\(g/cm^{3}\\) (the density of water is 1 \\(g/cm^{3}\\)). A stem with lots of vessels or large vessels would be less dense (as vessels are hollow) than a stem with little vessel tissue (because of more fibres). Dense Wood: Has better mechanical strength (fewer hollow vessels) Is better able to avoid embolisms related to drought (smaller vessels) Is found in species with slower growth and lower mortality (slower transport) Has a lower decay rate, thus slower carbon turnover rates Other relevant considerations: Lianas are climbing flowering vines, because they climb and are not free standing, they have less need for mechanical strength and therefore can have more vessels and larger vessels. Some temperate species are known as ring porous species; as they grow, they make large vessels in the spring when water is abundant and smaller ones in the summer when there is less water. Other temperate species are diffuse porous species with smaller vessels (water abundance is the same year-round, relatively lower than tropical). Tropical species are generally diffuse porous with large vessels (water abundance is the same year-round, relatively higher than tropical). Which of the above species would be more likely to leaf out earlier in the spring? Why do temperate species have smaller vessels than tropical species? If you are unsure, re-read the background information or ask for clarification. "],["Assignment.html", "3 Assignment 3.1 Part I: Structural Adaptation and Latitude 3.2 Part II: Structural Adaptations and Plant Categories 3.3 Formatting Instructions", " 3 Assignment For this assignment, we are using a dataset to examine how structural adaptations of plant stems vary concerning environmental factors. You are required to propose two questions/problems that can be studied using the dataset provided. You will formulate two hypotheses and select the appropriate information from the dataset to address each hypothesis. Finally, you will interpret and explain the result. This assignment has two parts: 3.1 Part I: Structural Adaptation and Latitude You are required to investigate whether there is a relationship between latitude and one structural adaptation in plant stems (Please note that latitude relates to climate). You must use ALL the data in the latitude column as one of the variables. You may choose data from any one of the other columns as the other variable. You will present your results in a scatter plot with a line of best fit and calculate th Pearson correlation coefficient. This will show the correlation between latitude and the structural adaptation of your choice. 3.2 Part II: Structural Adaptations and Plant Categories You are required to investigate whether there is a relationship between any structural adaptation in two categories of plant stems. Your investigation will be limited to 20 plants (2 groups of 10). How you group plants are up to you, but you will have to determine which plants fit into the groups so that some background research will be required on your part. For example, you can investigate any structural adaptation in any ONE of the following category sets or come up with your own categories (which must be approved by your lab instructor): Tropical vs. temperate plants (If you select this topic you are not permitted to use the variable that you studied in Part I), shrubs vs. trees, desert vs. rainforest plants, plants that grow in low elevation vs. high elevation You will have to define the specific criteria of your categories. For example, if you compare a structural feature of a stem for tall vs. short plants, you have to specifically state what qualifies as tall and what qualifies as short (as these terms are relative). This can be determined from your background research. To help with this research and sorting of data, you may want to check the following sites: Global Biodiversity Information Facility https://www.gbif.org/ OR https://www.canadensys.net. HAND IN You must present your results with boxplots or bar graphs to compare the means between categories (ex. trees vs. shrubs) and indicate a measure of error (i.e. standard deviation). Determine the statistical significance by performing a t-test and correlation test. More information for both can be found within the Statistics in R section of the Quantitative Skills for Biology. 3.3 Formatting Instructions Title: The title should be concise yet informative. It should hint at the question or the results found in the project. This title is specific to the project and not a general write-up title. Introduction: Present background information that is relevant to the problems you are studying. This background information or theory should help to formulate the questions and hypotheses. The introduction should include the questions that you are interested in studying for each part. Again, for Part I, this must be a relationship between latitude and some structural feature in plant stems, and for Part II, you may use the suggestions given or group the plants your own way. The introduction should end by providing two hypotheses (one each for Part I and Part II). Each hypothesis should be an educated guess which is formulated after you have done some background reading. Use information from peer-reviewed articles within your introduction. Methods: For Part I, state the columns of data that you worked with and the software used. For Part II, state the variable you examined, your two categories, the specific criteria used to include plants into each category and the software used. Results: For Part I, present a computer-generated scatter plot. In the text, describe the relationship you see (ex. positive, negative), give the Pearson correlation coefficient value, and state any outliers (i.e. dots that are far away from the rest?). Avoid the temptation to explain what is going on, leave that for your Discussion section. For Part II, present a boxplot or bar graph (with standard deviation bars) to compare the means between categories. In-text state which group has a higher mean value and which a lower mean value, the t-test value and if the two categories compared statistically different with respect to the structural feature. Again, avoid the temptation to explain what is going on, leave that for your Discussion section. Please Note: As part of the Results section for Part II, you are required to hand in a table including the plant species that you will be using in each category. This table should also include the appropriate data for the variable that you will be studying. Discussion: For both Part I and Part II, you are expected to begin by stating whether your results support your hypotheses. Then, explain why you see a relationship or, if appropriate, why not. As part of your explanation, find 2 related journal articles (1 for each part) and include details of their studies and relevant findings and state if the study results are consistent with yours (don’t forget to cite these articles in your discussion). Regardless of whether or not your hypotheses were supported, you should explain other factors that could affect the plants/study results such as elevation, wind, herbivory, etc. Your discussion should be well thought out and show an understanding of the topic studied and the factors that may affect tissue allocation in stems.

Review 7 Best Practices chapter of Quantitative skills for biology. It is best to make a folder on your computer Desktop where you will work on this assignment and stay organized. Download the file wood.csv from the course BrightSpace. Review 8.2 Loading or importing data. Open and save a new R Script (see 3.2 Source Pane if you are unsure how to do this). TRY IT! One of the first commands of your R Script will be to load your data, for example: data1 &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;woods_jake.csv&quot;) In the Console, inspect your data to check that it has loaded. TRY IT! For example: head(data1) If your data has not loaded, the most likely problem is a spelling error or problems with specifying the path to wood.csv. You might try: the RStudio way of importing your data, or moving wood.csv to your working directory. After importing the data into R, read through the metadata file to better understand the data.

See 8.4 Handling the data for how to recover the names of the columns for all the data. TRY IT! with the data you just imported. names(data1) ## [1] &quot;Family&quot; &quot;Binomial&quot; &quot;A.mm&quot; &quot;N.mm&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;logA&quot; ## [7] &quot;logN&quot; &quot;logF&quot; &quot;Dens&quot; &quot;AbsLat&quot; It is now helpful to begin thinking about the data. Do you hypothesize a relationship between the data in any of the columns? TRY IT! You might start investigating your hypothesis by making a plot, for example, showing the Average cross-sectional vessel area and the number of vessels. To extract a column of the data, see 8.4 Handling the data. For the Average cross sectional vessel area, in the Console, try: data1$A.mm Be sure to type exactly A.mm after the $. TRY IT! Try making your plot: plot(data1$N.mm,data1$A.mm, pch = 19, xlab = &quot;Average cross sectional vessel area&quot;, ylab = &quot;Number of vessels per unit cross sectional area&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;) The column names precisely as they appear in the output of names(data1) or RStudio will produce an error. TRY IT! Can you make a plot of different variables, for example, Wood density and Average of the absolute value of latitude? TRY IT! What happens if you type plot(data1$Family, data1$Binomial) in the Console? Why is this not a very sensible choice for something to plot? To analyze the relation between variables we can use the cor(x,y,method = \"pearson\") function. And it will give us a numeric description of the data’s relation (for more information about this topic:) 4.1 Sample with t.test A one sample test of means compares the mean of one sample to another sample or a pre-specified value and tests for a deviation from that value. More information can be found under [10. Statistics in R] (https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/statistics.html) of the Quantitative Guide. This section will give a brief overview of how to perform a sample t-test to compare the average cross-sectional vessel area between tall and short plants. First, produce two variables that contain the two categories of plants you want to investigate. Tall (Average plant height greater than 3 meters) cat1 &lt;-data1[0:10,0:3] head(cat1) Short (Average plant height less than 3 meters) cat2 &lt;- data1[11:20,0:3] head(cat2) After creating two variables that contain the two groups, calculate the means and the standard deviations of both groups. mean1 &lt;- mean(cat1[,3]) mean2 &lt;- mean(cat2[,3]) sd1 &lt;- sd(cat1[,3]) sd2 &lt;- sd(cat2[,3]) Once you’ve calculated the mean and standard deviation of the two groups, plot the results to compare the two groups. barplot(c(mean1,mean2), names.arg = c(&#39;cat1&#39;,&#39;cat2&#39;), main =&quot;Average cross sectional vessel area&quot;, ylim = c(0,0.0125), col = c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;)) This method can be helpful to visualize the difference between two groups but challenging to determine if the groups are significantly different or not due to random chance. Performing a t-test allows us to determine if the groups are statistically different and measures the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. Here, we want to evaluate \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), indicating that we are comfortable with a 5% risk of concluding a difference exists when there is no difference. If our p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\), both means are not statistically different (based on the datasets). Although, if the p-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\) then both means are statistically different: t.test(cat1[,3], cat2[,3], alternative = &#39;two.sided&#39;,paired = TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: cat1[, 3] and cat2[, 3] ## t = -0.052951, df = 9, p-value = 0.9589 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.008312154 0.007931926 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -0.0001901138 From the output above, we see that the \\(p-value = 0.9589\\), indicating that there is not a statistical difference in the average cross sectional vessel area between tall and short plants. Therefore, we can accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference in vessel area between tall and short plants. More information about t.tests are within the Statistics in R section of the Quantitative Skills for Biology guide. "]]
